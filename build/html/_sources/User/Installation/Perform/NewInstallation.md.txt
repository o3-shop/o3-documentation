# New Installation

## Create database

O3-Shop requires a MySQL or MariaDB database to store items, categories, customer and order data and other information.

Most web hosts offer database access via a special website, such as phpMyAdmin. If you need help with this, please contact your hosting partner or Internet Service Provider (ISP).

Create a new database. You can choose the name of the database freely, for example `o3_shop`.

## Provide shop files

The shop files are provided by Composer. The shop files are stored in a subdirectory that is specified in the command with **your_project_name**. This is based on the directory in which the command is issued in the terminal window. The parameter **--no-dev** is specified if the development-related files are not needed.

Open a terminal window and navigate to the main store directory.

Install the module executing the Composer command:

```
composer create-project --no-dev o3-shop/o3-shop your_project_name 1.1
```

```{note}
Use a different version constraint to install a different project version.

- `1.1` for the latest official release of the 1.1 branch
- leave empty for the latest official release
```

After Composer has finished its work, the new directory named *your_project_name* exists. This is the root directory of the project and contains all files needed for the installation of the O3-Shop.

## Adjust file and directory permissions

The HTTP server requires read and write access for the following directories and their subdirectories at runtime:

- `/source/export`
- `/source/log/`
- `/source/out/pictures/`
- `/source/out/media/`
- `/source/tmp/`
- `/var/`

In addition, the CLI user (Command Line Interface) also needs read and write access for the directory `/var/`.

For the web-based setup, the HTTP server must have write access to the following directory and these files:

- `/source/Setup`
- `/source/config.inc.php`
- `/source/.htaccess`

## Configure Apache

The root directory must point to a directory that the HTTP server can access. The document root directory of Apache must point to the ***/source*** directory of the main directory.

If you are able to run the setup application in the next this configuration was successful.

## Run web-based setup application

Open a browser and go to `www.yourshopurl.de/setup`.

Replace `www.yourshopurl.de` with the URL where your O3-Shop will be accessible.

### Requirements

Coloured symbols indicate whether the system requirements are met:

- ![](../../assets/install_pass.png) The prerequisite is fulfilled.
- ![](../../assets/install_pmin.png) The prerequisite is not or only partially fulfilled. The O3-Shop still works and can be installed.
- ![](../../assets/install_fail.png) The prerequisite is not fulfilled. The O3-Shop does not work without this prerequisite and cannot be installed.
- ![](../../assets/install_null.png) The prerequisite could not be checked.

1. Select the language for the installation.
2. Make sure that all system requirements are fulfilled in order to install the O3-Shop and operate it without problems. In case of configuration problems, contact your hosting partner or Internet Service Provider (ISP).
3. As soon as all system requirements are met (there are no red marks), press the **Start Setup** button.

### Welcome

1. Set the main delivery country and language of the shop. You can always add more delivery countries and/or languages later.
2. Recommended: Activate the checkbox for regular check for updates.
3. Select the Start shop installation button.

### Licence conditions

Check the licence conditions and accept them.

### Database

Create a database or integrate an existing database.

**Database Hostname or IP Address**

  You have the following options:

  - If the database and web server are on the same server, leave the default value localhost. This is the default for most shops.
  - If your database is outsourced, enter the host name or IP address of your database server. If you need to specify a port, it is placed after the host name and a colon (host name:port).

**Database Name**

  You have the following options:

  - Enter the name of your outsourced database.
  - If you do not have a database yet, enter a name for a database that the system creates during setup.

**Database user name** and **database password**

  Enter the access data for the database and keep it in a safe place.

**Demo data**

Decide whether you want to install the shop pre-configured with sample items.

Demo data is recommended if you want to familiarise yourself with the shop in a test installation first.

You can delete the demo data at any time if you want to fill the shop with your own articles.

If you do not yet have a database, select the **Create database now** button.

If you have integrated an existing database, a message appears that the database will be overwritten and that the required tables and data will now be saved in this database.

### Directories & Login

If necessary, adjust the directory settings and set the login data for the administration area of the shop.

Make a note of the following settings and keep the data in a safe place:

**Shop URL**

  Displays the URL under which your eShop will be accessible.

**Directory on the server to the shop**

  Indicates the internal path to the shop on the server (for example /var/www/your_project_name/source/).

  Adjust the path, for example, if you have several shops.

  You need the path in the last step of the setup.

**Directory on the server to the TMP directory**

  Names the directory in which the shop's temporary files, for example for Smarty or SEO cache, are stored.

  Background: Some modules ask you from time to time to delete temporary files manually.

**Administrator e-mail** and **administrator password**

  Enter the administrator's e-mail address and password.

  Use this data to log in to the administration area after the setup.

## Complete installation

### Setup directory

After successful installation, the **/setup** directory is automatically deleted. This is to prevent the setup from being called up again at a later time. Check whether the deletion of the directory was successful.

Also verify that the files config.inc.php and .inv in the shop's source directory are set to read-only. If not execute:

```{note}
chmod 0444 config.inc.php

chmod 0444 .env
```
