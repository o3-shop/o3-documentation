# Update

## Ensure

Ensure you have an error-free Composer installation of the OXID eShop.

## Prepare

Create a backup of the shop. This includes the database and the files on the server.

## Perform

### Update metapackage version in the composer.json file

Execute following composer command to update. Match the name with the version you want to udpate to (in the example 1.1):

```
composer require --no-update o3-shop/shop-metapackage-ce:v1.1
```

### Update dependencies

Open a shell in the main store directory and run the composer command below.
This will update all the required libraries.
Only specify the **--no-dev parameter** if you donâ€™t need the development related files.

```
composer update --no-plugins --no-scripts --no-dev
```

### Perform the update running the scripts

```
composer update --no-dev
```

```{note}
The update will overwrite any changes you may have made to modules or themes in the source directory.

Background: During a store update, Composer first loads the new data into the **vendor** directory. Then the data is copied to the **source** directory. This replaces the files of the store, the modules and the themes.

Your individual customizations of the O3-Shop or changes to third-party modules are only safe from being overwritten by the update if you have made the changes through one of the shop's extension options (component, module, child theme).
```

```{attention}
During the update you will be asked which packages may be overwritten.

To ensure that only compatible and tested packages are installed and to avoid inconsistencies and malfunctions caused by incorrectly implemented modules or themes, you have to confirm the queries with Yes.
b-1.x-ce-nightly` for the latest development versions of the 1.x branch. This is intended for development and testing purposes and should not be used for productive use!
```

### Empty ***tmp*** directory

To ensure that the cached items do not contain incompatibilities, empty the **tmp** directory:

```
rm -rf source/tmp/*
```

### Migrate database

```
vendor/bin/oe-shop-db_migrate migrations:migrate
```

### Regenerate database views

Depending on the changes and store edition, the store may go into maintenance mode after the update.
To prevent this, regenerate the database views with the following command:

```
vendor/bin/oe-shop-db_migrate migrations:migrate
```
