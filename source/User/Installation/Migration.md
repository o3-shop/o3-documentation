# Migrate from OXID eShop

In principle, a migration between the OXID eShop and O3-Shop is possible, but we recommend a new installation to get a clean installation.

## Requirements for a migration

Please ensure that **all** requirements are met:
- You start with an error-free Composer installation of the OXID eShop version 6.4.3 **Community Edition**.
  For older shop versions, please perform the update offered by OXID eSales to version 6.4.3 **before** you start the migration. Newer OXID shops (> 6.4.3) cannot be migrated.
  The migration only supports Community Editions. The migration of Professional or Enterprise Editions is not supported.
- The OXID eShop was installed via the package 'oxid-esales/oxideshop-project'. Check if 'oxid-esales/oxideshop-project' is mentioned as *name* in the file composer.json, located in the main directory of your shop. If you use a different package composition, please check its components manually to determine if they can be replaced.
- You have made a full backup of your installation (Files and Database) before proceeding with a migration

## Perform migration

### Replace packages

Open a terminal window and navigate to the main store directory. Exectue the commands:

```
isdev= && composer show oxid-esales/testing-* | grep -q . && isdev="1"
composer require -W o3-shop/shop-metapackage-ce:^1.0 --no-scripts --no-plugins
composer remove oxid-esales/testing-library oxid-esales/oxideshop-ide-helper --dev --no-scripts --no-plugins
composer require -W o3-shop/testing-library:^1.0 o3-shop/shop-ide-helper:^1.0 --dev --no-plugins --no-scripts
composer config extra.incenteev-parameters.dist-file 'vendor/o3-shop/testing-library/test_config.yml.dist' --no-plugins
composer remove oxid-esales/oxideshop-metapackage-ce --no-scripts --no-plugins
if [ -n "${isdev}" ]; then composer require o3-shop/shop-metapackage-ce:^1.0; else composer require --update-no-dev o3-shop/shop-metapackage-ce:^1.0; fi
```

Confirm all overwrite requests with ´y´.

If the Azure theme should be explicitly installed:

```
composer remove oxid-esales/azure-theme --dev
```

### Data migration

```
vendor/bin/oe-eshop-db_migrate migrations:migrate
```

### Complete migration

In the case of additional packages installed by OXID or individual compositions of the shop project, please check which packages need to be replaced from *oxid-esales* to *o3-shop*.
