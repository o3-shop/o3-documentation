# Modules

Extend the functionality of your O3-Shop with modules.

Use modules to

- map the business model of a shop operator
- to change the different areas of the online shop
  - the presentation of articles and categories
  - the order process
  - the payment
  - the shipping
  - offers and bonuses
- connect Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or content management systems with the O3-Shop
- exchange information with systems for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Product Information Management (PIM)

This part of the documentation describes modules for the O3-Shop.
